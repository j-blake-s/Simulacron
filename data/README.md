<h1 align = "center"> <i> Simulacron </i>  </h1>

The impetus for this project was a singular concept: *__spherical objects in a zero-g enviroment attracting and repelling each other.__* <br><br>
This concept was then expanded upon to consider multiple types of objects, enviroments, forces, and obstacles. Thus the need for a complex
and detailed program which could handle that level of variety. The end goal is to create beautiful scenarios, using the laws of physics and 
color overlays. Thus the mission of this project is two-fold, __*accurate physics simulations and pretty visuals*__.

The original project, which was the starting place for this code, was clunky and made very hap-hazardly during my senior year of high school.
This current project was started near the end of my Sophmore year, having learned a lot more about Computer Science fundamentals. As well as
gaining a lot more experience. One of the main reasons I undertook this project was to challenge my programming skills by adhering to 
the fundamentals of good software design such as:

- Modibility vs Extendability
- Cohesion vs Coupling
- Abstraction
- Inheritance
- Etc...
