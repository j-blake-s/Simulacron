<h3 align = "center"> Description: </h3>

The impetus for this project was a singular concept: *__spherical objects in a zero-g enviroment attracting and repelling each other.__* <br>
This concept was then expanded upon to consider multiple types of objects, enviroments, forces, and obstacles. Thus the need for a complex
and detailed program which could handle that level of variety.

The original project, which was the starting place for this code, was clunky and made very hap-hazardly during my senior year of high school.
This current project was started near the end of my Sophmore year, having learned a lot more about Computer Science fundamentals. As well as
gaining a lot more experience. One of the main reasons I undertook this project was to challenge my programming skills by adhering to 
the fundamentals of good software design such as:
   * Modibility vs Extendability,
   * Cohesion vs Coupling, 
   * Abstraction,
   * Inheritance,
   * Etc...
